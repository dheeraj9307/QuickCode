What is OOPS IN JAVA explain its principal? 
ðŸ’¡OOPs is a  (Object-Oriented Programming System), 
It  is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects and classes for organizing code. It is widely used in Java to achieve modularity, reusability, and maintainability.
It is based on four main principles (or pillars):
ðŸ”¹ Encapsulation â€“ Hiding internal data and providing controlled access.
ðŸ”¹ Inheritance â€“ Acquiring properties and behaviours from a parent class.
ðŸ”¹ Polymorphism â€“ One interface, many forms (overriding/overloading).
ðŸ”¹ Abstraction â€“ Hiding complexity, exposing only essential features. 
Note: Paradigm means a style or approach to writing and organizing code that defines how problems are solved and how programs are structured. 
Modularity is the concept of breaking a program into smaller, independent, and reusable parts called modules.
