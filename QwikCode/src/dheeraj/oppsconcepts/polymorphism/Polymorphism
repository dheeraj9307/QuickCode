If one task is performed in different ways is known as Polymorphism. 
It allows a method to behave differently based on the object or parameters,
Polymorphism is applicable only on method.
There are two ways It can achieve Polymorphism- 
i)Overriding(Run Time Polymorphism) 
ii)Overloading(Compile Time Polymorphism)  
METHOD-Overriding: 
Here we inherit a method from parent class and modify its logic in child class by once again creating same method in child class.
Or 
Changing the functionality of parents class method inside the sub class or child class is known as method overriding. 
Rules:
• Method name and parameters must remain the same.
• Return type must be the same or a subclass (covariant) of the original return type.
• It is used for runtime polymorphism.
METHOD-OVERLOADING:
• If we created more than one method with the same name in the same class provided, they have different number of arguments or different type of arguments is known as method-overloading.
Or 
Two or more methods(multiple methods)have the same name, in a same class, but passing the parameter should be different
means different number of arguments or type of arguments is known as method overloading. 
Or
When two or more methods have the same name in the same class but with 
different parameters — either in number or type — it is known as method overloading.
