/*
A Singleton can be thread-safe or not thread-safe, depending on how it's implemented.
How to make your Singleton thread-safe? 
Option 1:
I can make Singleton thread-safe by using Synchronized Method 
or 
make a Method Synchronized to get Singleton thread-safe 
(synchronized makes sure only one thread can enter this method at a time)
Option 2: Double-Checked Locking (Efficient)
Note:
The volatile keyword forces threads to read and write the variable directly from the main memory â€”
not from their local CPU cache.
So any thread will always see the most up-to-date value
